# loveletter_MA
This repository contains the XML file as well as the correspondence and transcriptions used for my master's thesis.

The aim was to annotate topics of everyday life in an exemplary love letter correspondence. The XML file contains 16 letters that were transcribed and annotated by using a categorial data model that was created for that purpose. 

Furthermore, you can view the original 52 letters as well as the transcriptions.
